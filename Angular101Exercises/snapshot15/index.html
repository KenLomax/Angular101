  <pre  style="background-color:#D1FFD1;">Note:  
   we are using a Factory to encapsulate functionality
    we inject that into the controller and use it
    this could be used by other controllers too.
    Factories, Services, Providers are all similar solutions.
  </pre>
    <ul>
    </ul>

   <pre  style="background-color:#FFCCCC;">But..

    But how does Restangular fit in to it?
